# Interaction Designer Technical Test

## Summary

* Created branches Master and Bev
* Tested : Google Desktop browser only - I'd issue with mobile connection and run app on real device (and Degug).
* In theory : three CSS markers for : Small Mobile + Large Mobile + Desktop : need test on real mobile device - but I'd connecton issue (adb)
* All jQuery/CSS transitions need replace for better performance (e.g. TweenJS or other). Standard jQuery/CSS overload mobile browser.
* UI for Large Mobile and Desktop isn't ready yet - need better design - e.g. flying wallet with Betslip or something 'stiched' to screen edge. WIll eye catch and easier navigate.
* Table 'Available Bets' need another row or better visual sign when pointer is hover and available to click (add to BetList). User will see clear and proper UX journey.
* Overall animations/transitions need more time for precision.
* So, overall app need definitely more development (code + UI/UX) - need more work (I spent around 3.5h + git preparation)

## Other
* Need rebuild some functions in main.js 
* add error handling
* add some lines for better design in 'renderTables'
* add LESS for CSS - any dynamic branding need this for quick management and development
* and more... (better design, better code, optimisation, manual QA, some font bold, )
* add UI for Desktop/Large Mobile...
* add some tables could be convert to DIV
* add fade for collapse Betslip & Receipts
* add fixed width and align to left/right in receipt - all message in one line

Thank you,
